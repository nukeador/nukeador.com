<p>At Mozilla’s <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Participation">Participation Team</a> one of <strong>our main goals is to support local communities</strong> and unleash contributions that will contribute disproportionately Mozilla’s<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/mission/"> mission</a> and goals.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1632" src="https://www.nukeador.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/reps-map.jpg" alt="reps-map" width="1004" height="315"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nukeador.com/28/08/2015/bringing-better-support-to-regional-communities/">Last year’s work</a> showed that <strong>we increase our impact by focusing our energies on a limited amount of clearly defined areas</strong>. Concentrating our effort as a team has become a key strategy for bringing more value to Mozilla.</p>
<p>One area we’ve looked at is the “where” we have Mozilla communities. We have volunteer Mozillians spread literally all over the world -- from Vancouver to Valladolid -- and many have organized themselves into geographically-based communities that our team supports (expect a future blog post on what we see as the value of organizing geographically). We know that the dynamics, opportunities and challenges of each of these communities is a bit different, and <strong>the more time we spend with any particular community the better we understand this uniqueness</strong>, leading to higher quality support and guidance.</p>
<p>At the same time, <strong>our staff time is limited</strong>, and so we can only “go deep” with a limited number of geographically-based communities at any given time. (This brings up another point of finding a leveraged model for staff effort, which is what is being tested now with the Reps Leadership efforts)</p>
<p>The question then became <strong>where to go deep?</strong> Since Mozilla doesn’t presently have a regional strategy overall, we did a basic analysis as Participation Team using the following factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web users and overall population.</li>
<li>Growth in web users.</li>
<li>How much the area influences markets/policies in other countries/areas -- this could be regionally or globally.</li>
<li>Where Mozilla can win (because of Firefox penetration, market sentiment, or cultural alignment with our values).</li>
<li>Momentum and strength of existing community.</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at this, we decided to <strong>focus the Participation Team’s efforts on the following 10 countries</strong> that align with our analysis and the capacity we think we have as a team to “go deep” right now:</p>
<ul>
<li>United States</li>
<li>Mexico</li>
<li>Brazil</li>
<li>United Kingdom</li>
<li>France</li>
<li>Germany</li>
<li>India</li>
<li>Philippines</li>
<li>Bangladesh</li>
<li>Indonesia</li>
</ul>
<p>What does this mean for a focus country practically? Here is what is guiding our goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will hold ourselves accountable for results/impact (customized to each country).</li>
<li>Go deep on staff support.</li>
<li>Initiate and deeply support regional gatherings and campaigns that will accelerate the development of these communities and the mobilizers/leaders in each one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, <strong>we recognize focus has a cost</strong> and that for the many Mozillians and communities not in these focus countries it can seem unfair and arbitrary -- we’re definitely empathetic to that. Let me be clear that <strong>the Reps and regional staff team will keep supporting communities outside these focus countries</strong>, just not as deeply or proactively as compared with the 10 focus countries.</p>
<p>As always, we expect our work and strategies to evolve over time and with input from many Mozillians. So please <strong>send along your questions or feedback</strong>.</p>
