<p>In <a href="https://www.nukeador.com/09/09/2016/investing-in-communities-with-a-clear-focus/">my previous post</a>, I explained how the Participation staff team was going to work with a clear focus, and today I want to explain how <strong>we are going to amplify this support to all local communities</strong> thanks to a project inside the Reps program called Regional Coaches.</p>
<p>Reps Regional coaches project aims to bring support to all Mozilla local communities around the world thanks to a group of excellent core contributors who will be talking with these communities and <strong>coordinating with the Reps program and the Participation team</strong>.</p>
<p>We divided the world into 10 regions, and selected 2 regional coaches to take care of the countries in these regions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Region 1:</strong> USA, Canada</li>
<li><strong>Region 2:</strong> Mexico, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Panama, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, Chile, Argentina, Cuba</li>
<li><strong>Region 3:</strong> Ireland, UK, France, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, Poland, Sweden, Lithuania, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, Czech Republic.</li>
<li><strong>Region 4:</strong> Hungary, Albania, Kosovo, Serbia, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Greece, Romania, Croatia, Bosnia, Montenegro, Ukraine, Russia, Israel</li>
<li><strong>Region 5:</strong> Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Jordan, Turkey, Palestine, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Iran, Morocco</li>
<li><strong>Region 6:</strong> Cameroon, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Senegal, Ivory Coast, Ghana</li>
<li><strong>Region 7:</strong> Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda, Madagascar, Mauritius, Zimbabwe, Botswana</li>
<li><strong>Region 8:</strong> China, Taiwan, Bangladesh, Japan</li>
<li><strong>Region 9:</strong> India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Myanmar</li>
<li><strong>Region 10:</strong> Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam, Australia, New Zealand.</li>
</ul>
<p>These regional coaches are not a power structure nor a decision maker, they are there to listen to the communities and establish a 2-way communication to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop a clear view of local communities status, problems, needs.</li>
<li>Help local communities surface any issues or concerns.</li>
<li>Provide guidance/coaching on Mozillaâ€™s goals to local communities.</li>
<li>Run regular check-ins with communities and volunteers in the region.</li>
<li>Coordinate with the rest of regional coaches on a common protocol, best practices.</li>
<li>Be a bridge between communities in the same region.</li>
</ul>
<p>We want communities to be <strong>better integrated with the rest of the org</strong>, not just to be aligned with the current organizational needs but also to allow them to be more <strong>involved in shaping the strategy and vision for Mozilla</strong> and work together with staff as a team, as One Mozilla.</p>
<p>I would like to <strong>ask all mozillians to support our Regional Coaches</strong>, helping them to meet communities and work with them. <strong>This project is key for bringing support to everyone</strong>, amplifying the strategy, vision and work that we have been doing from the Reps program and the Participation team.</p>
<h3>Current status</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.nukeador.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/regional-coaches.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1665 size-full" src="https://www.nukeador.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/regional-coaches.jpg" alt="regional-coaches" width="1182" height="662"></a></p>
<p>We <a href="https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/new-reps-regional-coaches-august-2016/10104">have on-boarded 18 regional coaches</a> to bring support to 87 countries (wow!) around the world. Currently they have started to contact local communities and hold video meetings with all of them.</p>
<p><strong>What have we learned so far?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mozilla communities are very diverse</strong>, and their structure and activity status is very different. Also, there is a need for alignment with the current projects and focus activities around Mozilla and work to encourage mozillians to get involved in shaping the future.</p>
<p>In <strong>region 1</strong>, there are no big formal communities and mozillians are working as individuals or city-level groups. The challenge here is to <strong>get everyone together</strong>.</p>
<p>In <strong>region 2</strong> there are a lot of communities, some of them currently re-inventing themselves to align better with focus initiatives. There is a huge potential here.</p>
<p><strong>Region 3</strong> is where the oldest communities started, and there is big difference between the old and the emerging ones. The challenge is to <strong>get the old ones to the same level of diverse activity</strong> and alignment as the new ones.</p>
<p>In <strong>region 4</strong> the challenge is to re-activate or <strong>start communities in small countries</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Region 5</strong> has been active for a long time, focused mainly in localization. How to<strong> align with new emerging focus areas</strong> is the main challenge here.</p>
<p><strong>Region 6 and 7</strong> are also very diverse, huge potential, a lot of energy. <strong>Getting mozillians supercharged again</strong> after Firefox OS era is the big challenge.</p>
<p><strong>Region 8</strong> has some big and active communities (like Bangladesh and Taiwan) and a lot of individuals working as small groups in other countries. The challenge is to <strong>bring alignment and get the groups together</strong>.</p>
<p>In <strong>region 9</strong> the challenge is to bring the huge activity and re-organization Indian communities are doing to nearby countries. Specially the ones who are <strong>not fully aligned with the new environment</strong> Mozilla is in today.</p>
<p><strong>Region 10</strong> has a couple of big active communities. The challenge is how to <strong>expand this to other countries</strong> where Mozilla has never had community presence or communities are no longer active.</p>
