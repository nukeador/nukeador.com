During this third quarter, one of <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0Bwl5PnEA3iBffjJhX01DV0FHSXJXYkVGUFNrWUhobmpJdGduYlpvOE1ZLUdyb2RxOGxJTmM">the main goals</a> for the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Participation">Participation team</a> at Mozilla is to <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/participation-org/issues/107">better support Reps and Regional communities</a>.

We want to focus our efforts this quarter in 10 countries to be more efficient with the resources we have and be able to:
<ul>
	<li>Tailor country profiles and a community health dashboard.</li>
	<li>Develop a mid-term plan with at least three communities.</li>
	<li>Systematize a coaching framework with volunteers.</li>
</ul>
As part of the Reps/Regional group I'm currently involved in these efforts, focusing in three European countries: Germany, France and UK.

During the past and following weeks I'll be meeting volunteers from these communities to know more about them and to figure out where to get some information that would help to develop the country profiles and the community dashboard, an important initiative to have a clear overview about our community status.

Also, I'm working with the awesome <a href="http://www.mozilla.de/">German community</a> to meet and work together in a plan to align and improve the community in the next 6 months.

On top of all the previous things, we are starting a set of 1:1 meetings with key volunteers inside these communities to bring coaching and support in a more personal way, understanding everyone's views and learning the best ways to help people's skills and motivation.

Finally, I'm working to improve the Reps/Regional team accountability and work-flow productivity exploring better ways to manage our work as a team and working with the Reps Council to put together a Rep program profile doc to understand better the current status and what should be changed/improved.
