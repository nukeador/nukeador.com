Following up from <a href="http://www.nukeador.com/28/08/2015/bringing-better-support-to-regional-communities/">my previous post</a>, I'm happy to say that during the last quarter we did (and accomplished) an amazing job as <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Participation">Participation team</a> in Mozilla. We were working as a team with a clear long-run mandate for the first time, and I think that was the key to have everyone motivated.

This quarter I'll be focusing on similar topics, some are follow-ups from previous quarter while others are new and challenging:
<ul>
	<li>Continue with volunteer coaching. Keep having 1:1s with key volunteers in different communities and helping them to draw their path as contributors, bringing and getting value from their work.</li>
	<li>Support German community to move forward with their plans and integrate new efforts we are driving on the ground around November campaign with the existing volunteers.</li>
	<li>Keep working on Mozilla Reps program and facilitate changes to adapt the program to the current environment as well as design opportunities to contribute with impactful activities.</li>
	<li>Experiment around tools and processes to improve how communities work and visualize their activities.</li>
</ul>
This is an exciting moment for participation at Mozilla and I'm sure this will mark a key advantage for the organization in 2016 that will allow Mozilla reach new frontiers.
