Edito: Parece ser que Youtube esta cargándose todos los videos que según ellos rompen algún copyright, podeis leer el correo que me mandaron en <a href="#mail">la parte final de la entrada</a>.

Os enlazo un par de videos que son muy buenos para que os echeis unas risas :)

"Detras de las camaras" de uno de los videos de Bin Laden acojonando a EEUU. No tiene desperdicio.

Editado: He enlazado otro video porque el link anterior murio, este tiene el final completo.
